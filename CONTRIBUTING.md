## Reporting bugs and opening issues

If you'd like to report a bug or open an issue then please:

**Check if there is an existing issue.** If there is then please add
   any more information that you have.

When submitting an issue please describe the issue as clearly as possible, including how to
reproduce the bug, which situations it appears in, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens.
If you can include a screenshot for front end issues that is very helpful.

## Coding Guidelines

### Pull Requests
We love pull requests, so be bold with them! Don't be afraid of going ahead
and changing something, or adding a new feature. We're very happy to work with you
to get your changes merged into this project.

If you've got an idea for a change then please discuss it in the open first.

### Style Check
This application uses `dartfmt`  for performing style checks on the codebase, which helps us in maintaining the quality of the code.
Please check that the code is properly formatted according to `dartfmt` and also resolve all the issues,
if any, shown by `dart analyze` before making a pull request.
**Pull Requests will only be merged once all the violations are resolved**.
